# ResoniteUnityExporter

A Unity Plugin to easily export Avatars or Worlds from Unity into Resonite.

It does this by:
- Grabbing the raw mesh, material, blendshape, bone, dynamic bone, etc. data directly from unity,
- Sends that to Resonite or the Standalone host over a loopback HTTP bridge,
- Decodes directly in Resonite

This lets us avoid any of the limitations of converting to an intermediate file first.

## Tutorial

### Installing the unity package

(If you have the old version, go to Assets and delete the ResoniteUnityExporter folder)

Click `Window` at the top of the screen, then select `Package Manager`.

![press package manager button](https://github.com/Phylliida/ResoniteUnityExporter/blob/main/TutorialAssets/package%20manager%20button.png?raw=true)

Press the `+` in the top left, and click `add package from git URL...`

![add package from git url](https://github.com/Phylliida/ResoniteUnityExporter/blob/main/TutorialAssets/add%20package%20from%20git%20url.png?raw=true)

Then add the url from the package repo:

```
https://github.com/Phylliida/ResoniteUnityExporterPackage.git
```

and press `Add`.

Click the new `ResoniteUnityExporter` tab at the top of the screen and click `Open Unity Resonite Exporter`.

![open unity resonite exporter](https://github.com/Phylliida/ResoniteUnityExporter/blob/main/TutorialAssets/open%20resonite%20unity%20exporter.png?raw=true)

You should see a menu pop up.

Adjust the `Avatar/World Name` as needed, and follow the instructions to set your near clip.

![Adjust name and near clip](https://github.com/Phylliida/ResoniteUnityExporter/blob/main/TutorialAssets/resonite%20exporter%20window.png?raw=true)

A correctly set near clip should be as small as possible while having nothing in the way.

For example:

![Correct near clip](https://github.com/Phylliida/ResoniteUnityExporter/blob/main/TutorialAssets/near%20clip%20fixed.png?raw=true)

Now you are ready to export your content to Resonite.

There are two options from here:

#### Run `ResoniteUnityExporterStandalone.exe`

This is a standalone program that uses Resonite libraries to convert your avatar/world into a .resonitepackage.

You can later copy paste the .resonitepackage in game to import your avatar.

This is easier to get setup and does not require any mods.

See [Running Resonite Unity Exporter Standalone](#running-resonite-unity-exporter-standalone)

#### Install `ResoniteUnityExporterMod`

This is a `ResoniteModLoader` mod for Resonite.

This mod allows Resonite to communicate directly with Unity.

When you press "Export to Resonite" your avatar/world will pop up in the world you are in.

See [Installing Resonite Unity Exporter Mod](#installing-resonite-unity-exporter-mod)

### Running Resonite Unity Exporter Standalone

When building from source on Linux, point the build at your Resonite install and
pass its executable path to Standalone:

```sh
dotnet build ResoniteUnityExporterStandalone/ResoniteUnityExporterStandalone.csproj -p:ResonitePath=/path/to/Resonite
dotnet ResoniteUnityExporterStandalone/bin/Debug/net10.0/linux-x64/ResoniteUnityExporterStandalone.dll /path/to/Resonite/Resonite.exe
```

The Unity package and the host must use the same bridge version. This HTTP
transport needs the companion ResoniteBridgeLib update; only one host (the mod
or Standalone) can listen on port 10020 at a time.

Go to the releases page

[https://github.com/Phylliida/ResoniteUnityExporter/releases](https://github.com/Phylliida/ResoniteUnityExporter/releases)

- Pick the most recent release
- Scroll down unitil you see `Assets`, expand it
- Download `ResoniteUnityExporterStandalone.exe`

![Download ResoniteUnityExporterStandalone.exe](https://github.com/Phylliida/ResoniteUnityExporter/blob/main/TutorialAssets/Download%20ResoniteUnityExporter%20Standalone.png?raw=true)

- Run it.
- It'll ask for your Resonite location, select `Resonite.exe` and press Ok.

(It needs this to use Resonite's libraries. This helps it be hopefully more forward compatible)

Now it should print out lots of text as it initializes things.

Eventually the text should calm down, once it does that you are ready to export your avatar/world!

Go to [Exporting to Resonite](#exporting-to-resonite)

### Installing Resonite Unity Exporter Mod

Go to the releases page

[https://github.com/Phylliida/ResoniteUnityExporter/releases](https://github.com/Phylliida/ResoniteUnityExporter/releases)

- Pick the most recent release
- Scroll down unitil you see `Assets`, expand it
- Download `rml_mods.zip`

![Download rml_mods.zip](https://github.com/Phylliida/ResoniteUnityExporter/blob/main/TutorialAssets/Download%20rml%20mods.png?raw=true)

Now you need to install `Resonite Mod Loader`. The easiest way is to use [Resolute](https://github.com/Gawdl3y/Resolute).

Once it is installed, navigate to your Resonite directory. It's probably something like:

```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Resonite
```

In there, create a `rml_mods` folder if it doesn't already exist.

Now unzip `rml_mods.zip` and still all the `.dll` files into `rml_mods`.

It should look like this when you are done:

![All the dlls are in the rml_mods folder](https://github.com/Phylliida/ResoniteUnityExporter/blob/main/TutorialAssets/rml%20mods%20done.png?raw=true)

(there may be more files if you also have other mods installed)

Now Unity can talk to Resonite. Go to [Exporting to Resonite](#exporting-to-resonite)

### Exporting to Resonite

You are ready to export to Resonite if, either:

- `ResoniteUnityExporterStandalone.exe` is running, or
- You've installed `Resonite Unity Exporter Mod` and are running Resonite

The Unity Plugin will then be able to connect to Resonite. It should look something like this

![Connected to Resonite](https://github.com/Phylliida/ResoniteUnityExporter/blob/main/TutorialAssets/connected%20to%20standalone.png?raw=true)

Press `Export to Resonite` to export your content!

This may take some time, be patient.

### Material mappings

Because Resonite does not have custom materials, your materials will need to be converted to standard resonite ones.

See the `Materials` tab to choose how you'd like this conversion to be done.

## Stuff supported
- Worlds and Avatars
- Mesh Renderer
- Skinned Mesh Renderer
- Blend shape values
- Relative transforms and names of all slots
- Bones, including:
  - Auto-rename to help Resonite (modified from [ResoniteImportHelper](https://github.com/KisaragiEffective/ResoniteImportHelper))
  - Null bones are supported (they just get a default bone made for them on the Resonite side)
- Dynamic Bone Chains and Colliders
- VRIK/Humanoid rig import
- Auto create and use Avatar Creator (including better auto-hand align)
- VRChat build hooks (including [VRCFury](https://vrcfury.com/) hooks)
- [Non-Destructive Modular Avatar Framework](https://github.com/bdunderscore/ndmf) hooks
- Position and Scale Constraints
- Most material properties (including textures), and you can choose which supported Resonite material to map to
- Lights (mostly, as much as I can with Resonite, baked lighting todo)
- LODGroups
- Colliders

## Todo

- Aim, Parent, LookAt, and Rotation constraints
- Baked lighting
- Reflection probes
- [Toggles](https://github.com/Phylliida/ResoniteUnityExporter/issues/12)
- Animations
- Better liltoon support (see [18](https://github.com/Phylliida/ResoniteUnityExporter/issues/18))
- [Linux Support](https://github.com/Phylliida/ResoniteUnityExporter/issues/15)
- [Option to put tooltip anchor on tip of first finger](https://github.com/Phylliida/ResoniteUnityExporter/issues/16)
- Particles
- Sounds
- Why hips rotated on certain avatars with null bones but only for Standalone? (maybe has to do with hack to avoid discord crash?)
- Asset bundle not working?
- Skybox
- Remember last resonite package save location
- Dynamic bone plane colliders (not sure how to do this...)

## Project Structure

`ExampleUnityProject` is a Unity project that has everything installed that you'll need,
feel free to open it up and add your avatar's unitypackage.

`ResoniteUnityExporterShared` contains the data structures used to represent mesh, texture, etc. data.
This library is used by the unity library and also by the mod and standalone.

`ImportFromUnityLib` is the library used in the Mod/Standalone, it contains the core of the code
to take the data and import it into Resonite.

`ResoniteUnityExporterMod` is the code for the Resonite mod, that uses `ImportFromUnityLib` to make the
avatar appear in whatever world you are in.

`ResoniteUnityExporterStandalone` is a standalone custom headless server, you can't connect to it and it's
anonomyous. This also uses `ImportFromUnityLib`, it's used to load resonite libraries needed to make a .resonitepackage.
This is also useful for debugging since startup time is much faster.

[https://github.com/Phylliida/ResoniteBridgeLib](https://github.com/Phylliida/ResoniteBridgeLib) is
a dependency of this library, it contains the inter-process communication and serialization code.

## I want to suggest a change
